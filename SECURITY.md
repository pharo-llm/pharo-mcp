- Share a clear description of the issue and why it matters.
- Include steps to reproduce (or a minimal proof of concept) when possible.
- Note the affected version(s), configuration, and environment details.
- Attach relevant logs or error output if available.

## What to Expect

- We will review reports as soon as possible.

- We may ask for additional details to reproduce or validate the impact.
- Please allow time for a coordinated fix before sharing details publicly.
