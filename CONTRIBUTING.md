Thank you for contributing to **Pharo-MCP**! These guidelines are here to keep collaboration smooth, consistent, and welcoming.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the project documentation so you can run and test things locally.

## Development Guidelines

* Follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the project.
* Add or update tests when you change behavior (features, fixes, refactors).
* Run the test suite locally before opening a pull request.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Keep your branch up to date with `main`.
2. Make focused commits with clear messages.
3. Open a pull request to `main` and explain:

   * what problem it solves,
   * what changed,
   * how it was tested.
4. Be responsive to review feedback—updates may be requested before merging.
